Projects generally address health and safety issues, but may also address accessibility and home efficiency. Costs for the projects will vary depending on the condition of the home and available funding. Typical repairs include roofing, plumbing, heating and electrical systems that may pose a health or safety hazard to the occupant. Additional considerations are given for disability access and features, as well as energy efficiency items that may result in lower utility costs to home owners. Applicants who qualify will have their house fully inspected. This will include a building performance inspection to ensure that all systems are properly, safely and efficiently working. Elderly or disabled homeowners will be surveyed for accessibility needs or necessary modifications to the house. For those deficiencies found during the inspection process, or accessibility needs, a detailed scope of work will be prepared to include a preliminary cost estimate, which will be reviewed by county and homeowner for approval prior to contacting properly registered and licensed contractors who perform the work. At the completion of the project, the City of Flagstaff Housing Rehabilitation Specialist will conduct a final inspection, on behalf of the County, to ensure that all work was properly performed as contracted between the homeowner and contractor. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E",county:b,category:{category:[e,o],sub_category:[x,N,av,aw],_id:Q},reviews:[],updatedAt:"2021-12-09T20:50:34.641Z",time:f},{id:662,business_name:cl,program_name:"IDA Match Saving Grants to pursue micro-business development or post-secondary education in Coconino County",address:{_id:fT,address_1:bA,address_2:a,city:d,state:c,postal_code:g,PlaceId:U,lat:S,lng:T},phone_num:ia,short_description:"\u003Cp\u003ECould IDA Help You Realize Your Dream?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWant a new career, or to start and\u002For expand a home-based or other small business?
